WHITEBoard ūnus is the Arduino Uno compatible board. It is based on ATmega328p microcontroler. Design of this board is based on a various boards, as there is not much to invent. My idea is not to bring something new, but to add another approvment that anyone can make his own development board.
Ūnus, as standard ATmega328p boards features:
* ATmega328p MCU TQFP
* 16MHz Clock speed
* micro USB
* FTDI FT232 UART
* 5V operating voltage
* 7-12V recomanded input voltage(VIN)
* 14 Digital IO
* 6 PWM output
* 8 Analog input
* 32KB Flash memory (0.5 KB bootloader)
* 2KB SRAM
* 1KB EEPROM
* Builtin LED 13 pin
* Dimensions 65x35mm
* 4 pin I2C header
* I2C, SPI, Serial interfaces

Ūnus, use Uno bootloader, rather then Nano because it saves precious memory. 

!!On protoype boards 5V and GND markings are switched!!
Schematics is ok.
